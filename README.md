# Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) project. The project was implemented in two parts: a MATLAB simulation and a hardware realization of the circuit.

# Overview
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent analog signals. It involves sampling the analog signal at regular intervals, quantizing each sample into a digital value, and then encoding these digital values into binary code words. PCM is widely used in telecommunications, audio recording, and many other applications.


## MATLAB Simulation
The MATLAB simulation in this project demonstrates the PCM process. It includes scripts and functions to generate analog signals, sample and quantize them, and encode the quantized samples into PCM code words. The simulation allows for adjusting parameters such as sampling frequency, quantization levels, and signal frequency to observe their effects on the PCM output.Below is the simulation output for the process :

# Hardware Realization
The hardware realization of the PCM circuit involves building a physical system based on the principles of PCM. This typically includes components such as analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), sampling circuits, and encoding/decoding logic. The hardware implementation aims to replicate the functionality of the MATLAB simulation in a real-world setting.

## Circuit Diagrams
### Sampler Circuit
The sampler circuit is responsible for sampling the analog input signal at regular intervals. It typically consists of a sample-and-hold circuit controlled by a clock signal.

### Quantizer Circuit
The quantizer circuit quantizes each sample from the sampler into a discrete digital value. It divides the input voltage range into a finite number of levels and assigns each level a corresponding digital code.

### Encoder Circuit
The encoder circuit encodes the quantized digital values into PCM code words. It converts each digital value into a binary code word according to the specified encoding scheme.

### Decoder Circuit
The decoder circuit decodes the received PCM code words back into digital values. It reverses the encoding process to recover the original quantized samples.

### Second Order Active Low Pass Filter Circuit
This is used to get a more refined analog output after the decoding part.
